## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I've learnt how to structure my web page better

```html
<div>
  <a class="links" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p>       
  <a class="links" href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a></p>
  <a class="links" href="https://fr.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></p>
  <a class="links" href="https://twitter.com/?lang=fr">Twitter</a></p>
  <a class="links" href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></p>      
</div>
```


### Useful resources

- [MDN mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for search for html and css elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me much more with css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
